## About
This is a music creation app with a limited degree of freedom. The user is given several backing tracks with pre-arranged instrument parts. They record their own sounds to voice these instrument parts. For example, instead of hearing a piano play the melody of the song, they can record a dog barking and the app will play the melody in dog barks.

## Instructions
1. Play the audio tracks at the bottom of the page and click the radio button to select your favorite one
    1. This will be the backing track for your song
1. Next you'll record a series of sounds that will be the instruments in your song

    1. We don't trim silent portions out, so please try to record your sound as soon as you click the button
